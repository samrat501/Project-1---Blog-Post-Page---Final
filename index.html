                <p>
                    Breaking into the world of front-end web development
                    is an exciting journey with plenty of
                    <a href="https://www.google.com">opportunities
                        to build your skills and creativity</a>. Front-end developers
                    are responsible for creating the parts of websites that
                    users interact with—everything from layouts and buttons
                    to images and menus.
                </p>

                <h2>Core Technologies For Web Development</h2>

                <p>
                    To become a front-end developer, you'll
                    need to learn the fundamental technologies
                    that power websites, like <a href="https://www.google.com">HTML, CSS, and
                        JavaScript</a>. With these skills, you can transform
                    basic designs into fully interactive and dynamic
                    web experiences.
                </p>

                <h3>The Fundamental Technologies</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the backbone of any website,
                        used to structure content like headings, paragraphs, and images.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) brings the layout and design to life,
                        controlling the website’s appearance across different devices
                        and screen sizes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        JavaScript adds functionality and interactivity,
                        making elements respond to user inputs and
                        enhancing the user experience.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    After gaining a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
                    it's important to put your knowledge into practice.
                    One of the best ways to learn is by working on small projects
                    like personal websites, portfolios, or simple web applications.
